# Exartu automates sales and recruitment processes.  

***

It allows sales professionals to efficiently manage prospects, and allows recruiters to manage their open jobs and related candidates and job assignments.  
This repository for the moment contains just the shell of a system that has been under development during the last year.

We're currently updating the core system to make the most of front end frameworks (Angular), mobile designs (Bootstrap) and cloud services (Nodejitsu).

Exartu is sponsored by Tempworks Software, Inc, of Eagan, MN, a provider of staffing software, payroll funding and processing, and document management systems.
